Vecty is a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)-like library for [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) so that you can do frontend development in Go instead of writing JavaScript/HTML/CSS.

Features
========

-	Share frontend and backend code.
-	Write everything in Go -- not JS/HTML/CSS!
-	XSS protection: unsafe HTML must be explicitly denoted as such.
-	Reusability: share components by making Go packages that others can import!

Goals
=====

-	Simplicity
	-	Keep things as simple as possible to understand *for newcomers*.
	-	Designed from the ground up to be easily mastered (like Go)!
-	Performance
	-	As efficient as possible, make it clear what each operation in your webpage will do.
	-	Same performance as just using plain JS/HTML/CSS.
-	Composability
	-	Nest components to form your entire user interface, seperate them logically as you would any normal Go package.
